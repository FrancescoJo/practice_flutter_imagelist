# practice_flutter_imagelist

Demo project to practise [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) framework.
These programming skills/concepts/whatever are used:

 - Async/wait, ReactiveX
 - Internationalisation (i18n), Hot reload
 - Async image downloading
 - Memory, Disk caching
 - Vertical List View
 - [Flutter app lifecycle](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/dart-ui/AppLifecycleState-class.html)

Note that app-side jargons like `View`, `Model`, `ViewModel`, `Widget`, etc., in this project,
are used in confusion since I'm very new to Flutter and its design principals. Please correct me
if you found something wrong.
